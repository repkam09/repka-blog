Adding a new post is as simple as creating a new `.md` file in the `src/posts/` directory.

The frontmatter at the top (between the `---` lines) defines the metadata:

- **title** — displayed as the heading and in the post list
- **date** — used for sorting and display
- **description** — useful for SEO and the RSS feed

Everything below the frontmatter is your post content, written in standard Markdown.

You can also include images that live right next to this file:
